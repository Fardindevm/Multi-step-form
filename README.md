I'm pleased with how I managed React state and smoothly handled it in child components. I implemented error states effectively for phone numbers, names, and emails. By utilizing the react-phone-number-input library, I was able to seamlessly incorporate international calling codes and dynamically display country flags based on the inputted country code.
